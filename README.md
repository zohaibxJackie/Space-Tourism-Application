## My process

### Built with

- Html 5
- Vanilla CSS
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned
By building this application, I learned a lot about React. I learned how to manage layouts for different devices, and I learned how to manage different images based on sizes. I learned routing which is an important concept in react. Really enjoyed the process of building this application.

### Continued development

Although, I have learned a lot from this project but there are still many areas where I need improvements.
